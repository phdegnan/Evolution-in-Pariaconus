# Evolution in Pariaconus

Hawaiian *Pariaconus* psyllid species have undergone a rapid adaptive radiation on the Hawaiian Islands, evolving various galling and free-living ecologies on a single host plant species, *Metrosideros polymorpha*. In Degnan et al. (in review) we describe the genome sequence of the typical psyllid primary endosymbiont "*Candidatus* Carsonella ruddii" from *Pariaconus montgomeri*. In addition, we mine metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data to report the mitochondrial and several CORE nuclear genes for 7 insect hosts. We use these data to compare absolute rates of change in the different genomic compartments (e.g., nuclear, mitochondria, 3 endosymbiont lineages).

A description of general analytical steps and several custom PERL scripts are included here.
